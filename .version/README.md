## .version

### [.versionmap](../.version/.versionmap)

This shows which versions for each module is currently installed.

### [update.sh](../.version/update.sh)

This script can be used to update all the utilities. This also asks whether you'd want to include some modules and which you do not want. The versions for every module installed can be found in the [.versionmap](../.version/.versionmap) file.

> [!CAUTION]
> This does overwrite all the README.md files.
