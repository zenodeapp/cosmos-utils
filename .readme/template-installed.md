# Utilities

This contains useful scripts for maintaining a Cosmos SDK based node setup and comes from the [`cosmos-utils`](https://github.com/zenodeapp/cosmos-utils) repository.

This has been written by ZENODE and is licensed under the MIT-license (see [LICENSE](./LICENSE)).

## \_variables.sh

This holds all the repository-specific variables shared with most of the scripts. This makes it easier to adjust the chain-id, binary name or node directory without having to change it in a lot of different files.
