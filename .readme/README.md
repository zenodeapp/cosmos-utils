## .readme

These scripts are not part of the utilities, but makes it easier to maintain the the main [README.md](../README.md) file.

### [generate.sh](../.readme/generate.sh)

This regenerates the main [README.md](../README.md) file based on the individual README's for every module.

### [filter.sh](../.readme/filter.sh)

This filters away all the modules we do not include during the installation. This to prevent getting information on modules we do not have.
